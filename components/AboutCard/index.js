          Hi Everyone, I am{" "}
          <strong className="gradient-color">Shenggui Li (Frank)</strong>. I am
          an incoming PhD student of the üìç S-Lab in Nanyang Technological
          University @ Singapore, advised by Prof. Tianwei Zhang and Prof. Ivor
          Tsang. Prior to that, I obtained my ü§ì B.Eng in Computer Science in
          Nanyang Technological University in 2021 advised by Prof Chen Change
          Loy.

          My interest lies at the intersection of ü§ñ machine learning and ‚ö°Ô∏è
          high performance computing. I first proposed the idea of sequence
          parallelism in 2021, which is now essential to large-scale model
          training. I am the author of Ring Self-Attention and ColossalAI.
          During my undergraduate study, I had the privilege to spend wonderful
          2 years on the NTU HPC Team and we won the overall ü•à 2nd place in the
          student cluster competition of ISC21.
          <br />
          <br /> I am participating in exciting projects such as &nbsp;
